# MultithreadedParkingSystemSimulation
This project simulates a parking system using multithreading techniques to manage parking slots, vehicle entry, and exit. It demonstrates concurrent programming concepts in Java by simulating a system where multiple vehicles can park and exit concurrently, handling resource contention and synchronization.
